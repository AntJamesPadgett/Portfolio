<p id="para1">Thank you for checking out my portfolio page, Im Anthony J Padgett and I am a Software Developer. Im very excited that you decided to join my on my journey.
       I started this adventure a little over a year and a half ago, and I have enjoyed every challenging minute of it.

       I would have to say C# has been my favorite part of the course.. very challenging, but still my favorite module of the course, with front-end work a very close second place.

        <h1>Mercedes Benz US International -- Flex Team lead
            2017-2021
        </h1>
        <p>
       My last position at MBUSI was as a Flex team lead. I was the point man over a large wharehouse area of the plant.

       My day to day job dealt with me leading seven team members as well as being the MBUSI liason with the contracting company building the cockpits in that area of the plant. In a nutshell, my seven team members trained the contracting company and made sure the companys quality was up to standard. The  contracting company we trained  had roughly  fifty to sixty plus team members and we trained all of them. Any issues that arose, we had to handle and feed back. 
       </p>
       <p>
       I was trained from the ground up how to build the cockpit and center console and communicated build quality issues with engineers. From there my people got trained and we then trained the contracting
       company. Each and every cockpit on my shift was quality tested via PLUS systen for wrong installed parts, parts not sequenced correctly or  cockpit that wasnt computer tested to show no faults, and was responsible for the plant hand off from contractor to MBUSI. ALso had to have meetings every two hours with plant upper management on how things were going in my area, keeo up with parts  stock as well.

       </p>
       <h1> Mercedes Benz US International -- trim side online Team Leader 2011-2017</h1>
       <p>
           I was promoted to Team lead and was responsible for a zone on line. My zone consisted of eight team members and I was to train them in all processes, cover them when soneone needed to go to the restroom or if someone called in that day. lso it they had an issue with a car they worked on, I was to fix the issue and feedback the solution to the issue.</p>
        <p>
        During this time, I was stationed in the middle of the line, I took it apomd myself to start learning different zones on line, until i knew the entire line all forty processes, it came in handy when another team leader was off or online..I could cover their perspective zones, also if someone in their zone needed a restroom break or something fixed, I could handle it myself without having to wait for back up.
       </p>

       <h1> Mercedes Benz US International -- Team Member 2004-2011</h1>
       <p> I started out at MBUSI as a temp / contract employee. After six months I was hired on permanently.
           During this time i learned the fundamentals of buidling cars and attention to detail and what it took to build a world class car, also started learning stations in other zones.
